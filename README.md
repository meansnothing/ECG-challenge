    Quick experiments with following settings:  
    The testing dataset contains 300 patients, 100 for each BMI group (random selected). 
    3 Groups are equally separated according to the BMI values (from low to high). 
    The training dataset contains all the other patients with MI annotation.
    Group 1: auc = 0.5687
    Group 2: auc = 0.57969
    Group 3: auc = 0.61682
