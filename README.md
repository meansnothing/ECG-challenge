# ECG-challenge
This repository presents an example of exploring bias in a 
neural network-based model predicting myocardial infarction from electrocardiograms.

The work has been carried out in connection with the Data Science Spring School & Challenge for Early Career Researchers & Professionals 2022.

# Background
Electrocardiographic characteristics have been shown to be influenced by patient body mass index. 


# Aim





# Visualization

# Experiment

    models/ are copied from repository Deep Learning for ECG Analysis: Benchmarks and Insights from PTB-XL.
    Quick experiments with following settings:  
    The testing dataset contains 300 patients, 100 for each BMI group (random selected). 
    3 Groups are equally separated according to the BMI values (from low to high). 
    The training dataset contains all the other patients with MI annotation.
    Group 1: auc = 0.5687
    Group 2: auc = 0.57969
    Group 3: auc = 0.61682
