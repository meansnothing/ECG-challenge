# ECG-challenge
This repository presents an example of exploring bias in a 
neural network-based model predicting myocardial infarction from electrocardiograms (ECGs).

The work has been carried out in connection with the Data Science Spring School & Challenge for Early Career Researchers & Professionals 2022.

# Background
Electrocardiographic characteristics have been shown to be influenced by patient body mass index. 


# Aim
In this project, we aimed to explore if patient body mass index influences the performance of a neural network-based model predicting myocardial infarction from 12-lead ECGs.

    The testing dataset contains 300 patients, 100 for each BMI group (random selected). 
    3 Groups are separated according to the BMI values:  
    Group 1: 
        Below 18.5 = Underweight
        18.5–24.9 = Normal weight  
    Group 2:
        25.0–29.9 = Pre-obesity  
    Group 3:
        30.0–34.9 = Obesity class I
        35.0–39.9 = Obesity class II  

    The training dataset contains all the other patients with MI annotation.
