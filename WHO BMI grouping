WHO BMI grouping

BMI - Nutritional status
Below 18.5 = Underweight
18.5–24.9 = Normal weight
25.0–29.9 = Pre-obesity
30.0–34.9 = Obesity class I
35.0–39.9 = Obesity class II
Above 40 = Obesity class III


Alternatively, with fewer groups:

Below 18.5 = Underweight
18.5–24.9 = Normal weight
25.0–29.9 = Overweight
Above 30 = Obesity
